## Installation

```bash
# From source

>> git clone https://github.com/SiddeshSambasivam/Canny-edge-detector.git

>> pip install .
```

## Examples

```python
import cv2
from canny_edge_detector import canny, ImageHandler

img = cv2.imread('./tests/data/test.png', 0)

out = canny(
    img, 
    low=5, high=20, 
    verbose=True, 
    save_outputs=True
)

```

## Project requirements

1. Take pictures of a B&W chessboard at a high resolution (eg. 3000x4000)
2. Apply your Canny edge detector to these images (grey scale) with accuracy to pixel level (integer)
3. Reduce the size to Â¼ of the original image (eg 750x1000), then apply the Canny edge detector with sub-pixel accuracy. 
    * The output is a list of edge pixels with decimal points numbers. 
    * Casting these edge pixels to its original size of 3000x4000 and make a comparison with the results obtained in 2. 
    * Discrepancies can be presented in the report/during the face-to-face assessment.
4. Repeat the above to photos with daily life settings.

## Canny edge detection algorithm 

The process of Canny edge detection algorithm can be broken down to five different steps:

</p>


1. Apply Gaussian filter to smooth the image to eliminate noise.   

    * The larger the width of the Gaussian mask, the lower is the detector's sensitivity to noise
    * Convolve the filter over the image 

2. Find the intensity gradients of the image; image gradient to highlight regions with high spatial derivatives

3. Apply gradient magnitude thresholding or lower bound cut-off suppression to get rid of spurious response to edge detection

4. Apply double threshold to determine potential edges

5. Track edge by hysteresis: Finalize the detection of edges by suppressing all the other edges that are weak and not connected to strong edges.

## Development setup

1. Setup the dev environment

    *Prereq: Miniconda was used to setup the development environment.*

    ```bash
    > conda create --name canny python=3.8
    > conda activate canny
    > pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the tests 

    ```bash
    > pytest -v
    ```
